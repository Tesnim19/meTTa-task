### Reasoning for Maximum Depth Calculation Using Structural Induction

**Base Case**: A tree with only a root node has a depth of 1. The function handles this by returning `1` when the tree consists solely of a single node `($x)`.

**Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume the function `max-depth` correctly calculates the depth for any tree of size `n`.

**Inductive Step**: 
- For a tree with one subtree `($x $y)`, the function returns `(+ 1 (max-depth $y))`, adding 1 to account for the root.
- For a tree with two subtrees `($x $y $z)`, the function computes the depth as `(+ 1 (max (max-depth $y) (max-depth $z)))`, adding 1 for the root and using the `max` function to find the greater depth between the two subtrees.

The use of `max` ensures the function correctly identifies the deeper subtree and adds 1 for the root node at each level.

**Conclusion**: By structural induction, this approach guarantees the `max-depth` function correctly calculates the maximum depth for any binary tree configuration, from a single node to complex multi-level trees.
