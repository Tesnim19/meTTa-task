### Reasoning for Counting Symbol Occurrences 

**Base Case**: The function checks the root of the tree `($x)`. It returns `1` if the root matches the given symbol `($x == $symbol)`, otherwise `0`.

**Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume the function `count` correctly counts the occurrences of a symbol in any binary tree of size `n`.

**Inductive Step**: 
- For a tree with three nodes `($x $y $z)`, the function recursively counts the occurrences in each subtree and the root:
  - `count $x $symbol`: Counts occurrences in the left subtree.
  - `count $y $symbol`: Counts occurrences in the right subtree.
  - `count $z $symbol`: Counts occurrences in an additional subtree or node.
  The function sums these counts, ensuring it captures all occurrences of the symbol in the tree.
- For a tree with two nodes `($x $y)`, the function recursively counts occurrences in both the child and the root, summing the results.

**Conclusion**: By structural induction, the `count` function ensures that it accurately counts the total number of occurrences of a given symbol in any binary tree, summing the counts from each part of the tree structure.
